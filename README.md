## Overview

BaseScrambler is a small encryption project I've been working on. The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt data using a custom algorithm.

## Features

- Custom encryption algorithm
- Easy to use interface
- Lightweight and efficient

## Getting Started

To get started with BaseScrambler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/babafun/BaseScrambler-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd BaseScrambler
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
