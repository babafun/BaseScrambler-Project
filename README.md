# The BASEScrambler Project

## Overview

BaseScrambler is a small encryption project I've been working on. The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt data using a custom algorithm.

## Features

- Custom encryption algorithm
- Easy to use interface
- Lightweight and efficient

## Getting Started

To get started with BaseScrambler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/babafun/BaseScrambler-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd BaseScrambler
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To encrypt a file, first open up any one of the Python or HTML files. For a Python file, enter this into the terminal:
`
sh
python name-of-file.py
`
Make sure that when you send someone the encrypted message (it will be in plain text), you tell them which version you're using! Not all versions are the same!
See more [here](USAGE.md).
